    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>    <p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-11-15">November 15, 2016</time></p>
  </header>  <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><b><i>sous vide</i></b></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30"><b>November 30</b></time>.</p></article><footer><div id="about">
